;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This module provides packages for cross compilation toolchains.  These
;;; packages must not be used at the top level to avoid cyclic module
;;; dependencies caused by the (gnu packages cross-base) module referring to
;;; to top level bindings from (gnu packages gcc).
;;;
;;; The real purpose of these packages is for installation on profiles by users
;;; and other packages should make use of the toolchain through the usual cross
;;; compilation methods. For example, by using the `#:target' argument on
;;; packages or `--target' on the command line.
